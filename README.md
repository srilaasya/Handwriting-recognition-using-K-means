# Handwriting-recognition-using-K-means
This project is currently implemented using K-means clustering and scikit-learn to cluster images of handwritten digits. The same project implemented using Multilayer Perceptrons is under construction. 
I am currently working on building the same project on MNIST dataset using MLPs.
